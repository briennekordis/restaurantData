## Description 
This project uses GraphQL to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) restaurant data (in JSON format). 

## SetUp
0.Prerequisite: Make sure you have Node installed on your computer
1. Download or clone the index.js file
2. Open up Terminal (OSX)/or equivielent command line and navigate to the directory of the index.js file
3. run `npm install` from the command line
4. run `node index.js` from the comman line
5. navigate to localhost:550/grapghql in your browser to open up the GrapghQL Playground connected to the index.js file
6. Paste the code from the grapghql file in this directory into the editor on the left side of the GraphQL Playground
7. Click on the "Play" arrow button in the GraphQL Playground to run the different mutations. The returned data will appear on the right side of the screen. 

## Roadmap for Improvement
- Currently, the restraurants data is stored as a variable within the index.js file. While this allowed the project to work easily in the GrapghQL Playground, it would be advisable to seperate the data into a JSON file to clean up the index.js file.
